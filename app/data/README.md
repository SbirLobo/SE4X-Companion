## highlighted field

Two files use a `highlighted` field to surface official post-publication corrections or clarifications from GMT Games player aid cards (PAC). The field is empty for entries that have no correction.

### card_manifest.json — `highlighted`

Editorial note indicating that the card text was corrected or clarified relative to the original printed card. The correction source is always a GMT Games player aid card (e.g. *PAC Planets v3*).

Example: `"Text corrected per PAC Planets: added '(including LONGBOWMEN ships)'."`

### deep_space_planet_attributes.json — `highlighted`

Same purpose: flags that the planet attribute text differs from the printed counter and was corrected via a GMT Games player aid card.

Example: `"Text corrected per PAC Planets: added 'before and' to movement restriction."`
